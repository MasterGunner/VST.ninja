<h1>Desert Bus Chat</h1>
<p>The Desert Bus community hangs around all year at <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.desertbus.org/desertbus">irc.desertbus.org</a>, come in for a chat!</p>
<p>During Desert Bus For Hope itself, we relocate to the "bunker", so as to avoid adding strain to the Desert Bus servers. You can find it over at <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.chatspike.net/DesertBusBunker">irc.chatspike.net #DesertBusBunker</a>.</p>
<p>If you would rather use a dedicated chat program, rather than the web clients linked above, we recommend <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a>. If you have trouble setting it up, hop into chat using the above web client link, and someone will be able to help you out.</p>
