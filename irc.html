<p>The Desert Bus Chat is a great community that exists year-round. Playing games, talking TV and movies, and always lending an ear to those who need one. Come on by, and feel free to join us. <br /><br />
If you would rather use a dedicated chat program, rather than the web clients linked below, we recommend <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a>. If you have trouble setting it up, hop into chat using the web client, and someone will be able to help you out.</p>

<h2>Desert Bus IRC</h2>
<p>This is the normal hangout of the Desert Bus community, you can find us here all while Desert Bus for Hope isn't going on: <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.desertbus.org/desertbus">irc.desertbus.org</a></p>

<h2>Desert Bus Bunker</h2>
<p>During Desert Bus For Hope itself, we relocate to the "bunker", so as to avoid adding strain to the Desert Bus servers. You can find it over at <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.chatspike.net/DesertBusBunker">irc.chatspike.net #DesertBusBunker</a>.</p>

<h2>Twitch Chat</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/desertbus">The Twitch chat</a> is where the action happens during the event itself, to talk with the crew on the stream and others watching along with you. <br />
If you want to connect to Twitch Chat using an IRC client, refer to <a href="http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1302780-twitch-irc">this handy guide.</a></p>
